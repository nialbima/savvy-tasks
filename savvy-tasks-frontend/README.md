# OKAY, A RECAP

1. We have react + next running
2. We have an example for redux that seems fairly straightforward.
3. This isn't ultimately a terrifically complicated application. We need one form, and one table, with columns.
4. We have a backend Apollo client ripped from the docs, and that'll work.
5. We need to be careful about distinguishing between front and backend Apollo calls, and making sure that SSR can be functional.

As a user, when I load the Tasks page, I should see all tasks associated with my account.
