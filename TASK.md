# Overview

You are tasked with building a simple task management system where users can
manage their daily tasks. The application should include a backend built with Rails 7
and GraphQL, and a frontend developed with React and TypeScript.
Objectives
● Backend (Rails 7 + GraphQL):
● Develop a Rails API to handle CRUD operations for tasks.
● Implement GraphQL queries and mutations for interacting with task data.
● Ensure the application is connected to a PostgreSQL database.
● Frontend (React + TypeScript):
● Build a user interface using React and TypeScript that interacts with the
backend via GraphQL.
● The UI should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
● Implement state management effectively, considering the application's
scalability.

Functional Requirements

1. Task Model:
   ● Attributes:
   ● id: Integer (auto-generated)
   ● title: String
   ● description: Text
   ● completed: Boolean (default: false)
   ● due_date: Date (optional)

2. Backend:
   ● Set up a Rails project with GraphQL.
   ● Create necessary models, migrations, and seed data.
   ● Define GraphQL types, queries, and mutations for tasks.
   ● Implement necessary resolvers for task management.
3. Frontend:
   ● Create a React application using TypeScript.
   ● Setup Apollo Client to communicate with the GraphQL backend.
   ● Develop components for task display, task entry, and task updates.
   ● Implement routing and navigation.
   Non-Functional Requirements
   ● Code Quality:
   ● Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
   ● Ensure the code is well-documented and easy to understand.
   ● Design:
   ● Follow basic principles of user interface design and user experience.
   ● Security:
   ● Implement basic security practices to protect data integrity and prevent
   common vulnerabilities.
   Deliverables
   ● A GitHub repository containing the complete project code.
   ● A README file with:
   ● Instructions on how to set up and run the application.
   ● A brief explanation of the project structure and components.
   ● A short reflection on the choices made during development, including any
   challenges faced and how they were addressed.
   Evaluation Criteria
   ● Functionality: The application meets all the functional and non-functional
   requirements.
   ● Code Quality: The codebase is clean, well-organized, and easy to read.
   ● Problem Solving: Ability to tackle problems effectively and implement solutions.
   ● Creativity and Innovation: Use of best practices in design and coding.
